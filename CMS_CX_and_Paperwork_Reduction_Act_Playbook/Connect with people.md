# **2️⃣ Offices and Centers**

Almost all offices within CMS interact with the public. When your research question is related to work that might already be in flight it would be important to ask the groups who might have already conducted similar research. This would reduce the amount of burden we put on the public, but also allows you share learnings and insights across the organization.
