# What qualifies for fast-track approval

See [https://coda.io/d/_d1rO7wRDMh7/_su7N0](https://coda.io/d/_d1rO7wRDMh7/_su7N0) to learn about other clearance types and existing clearances you can use. Learn more at [https://coda.io/d/_d1rO7wRDMh7/_su16c](https://coda.io/d/_d1rO7wRDMh7/_su16c) for how to apply for a new generic clearance.. 

Your data collection activity may be eligible for the Fast Track process if it meets all of the below factors:

- [ ] Focused on improving existing or future services, products, or communication materials
- [ ] Participation is voluntary
- [ ] Statistical rigor is not required
- [ ] Burden on participants is not high
- [ ] Public dissemination of results is not intended

Once OMB approves the initial ICR, subsequent general information collections (GenICs) submitted under the approved Fast-track generally donâ€™t have to undergo additional public comment, and are reviewed after submitting all materials. 

**Timeline:** 2 weeks to 30 days for approval. However, this timeline depends on OSORA and OMB approval. Generally, OSORA will submit the collection upon receipt or shortly thereafter. While approval will not take as long as a regular (non-generic, non-fast track) package, it may be longer than five days. A month is a reasonable amount of time to expect, so be sure to give yourself sufficient lead time.



# Fast-track approval process

The fast-track approval process boils down to two steps:

1. Prepare your information collection request (ICR) materials
2. Submit your ICR materials to OSORA



### Step 1: Prepare your ICR materials

- Complete a short form for the ICR
- Include a copy of collection instruments or research artifacts with PRA Disclosure Statement



### Step 2: Submit your ICR materials to OSORA

- CMS POC submits package to OSORA
- OSORA will review and request any necessary edits or changes
- OSORA submits the package to OMB



### Step 3: Wait for OMB Review and approval

Please allow for month for up to one month for OMB approval. OMB has five business days for initial review. Most of the time, OMB will have one or more questions as a result of this review. 

- OSORA will contact you if OMB has a question or requires more information
- If OMB inquires within those five days, they have an additional five days to respond after your response is submitted via OSORA.
  - If OMB does not respond within five business days, then OMB will notify your agency that OMB has approved the collection and your agency may proceed with the collection under the OMB-issued control number for the approved generic clearance. However, agency program staff must consult OSORA to confirm that OMB issued a Notice of Action (approval) or to confirm OMB has additional concerns regarding the proposed information collection request
- Once approved is received from OMB, OSORA will contact you with approval to proceed with your information collection
