Knowing who you’re getting feedback from improves understanding how to reduce public burdens.  Depending on who (and how many people) you’re getting feedback from, including other considerations, your research may be subject to PRA or invite certain limitations on how and when you ask for feedback. 

Should you have any questions, don’t hesitate to reach out to OSORA. See [https://coda.io/d/_d1rO7wRDMh7/_sud6M](https://coda.io/d/_d1rO7wRDMh7/_sud6M)

# General Audiences

When receiving feedback from the broad audiences, you should keep in mind when PRA clearance may or may not be needed. See [https://coda.io/d/_d1rO7wRDMh7/_suKbU](https://coda.io/d/_d1rO7wRDMh7/_suKbU) for more information.

Broad audiences, everyone in the country, an entire pillar of CMS

### Examples

- Medicare Beneficiaries
- Medicaid beneficiaries
- People with behavioral health issues

# Informed Audiences

Sometimes we try to receive feedback from informed audiences. This includes narrow audiences, people who are knowledgable about the topic but might not have specialized knowledge.

### Examples

- Physicians
- Broad medical providers

# Small groups of people or organizations

In some cases the individuals or organizations that we are looking for feedback from are a small handful of people or organizations with unique circumstances. Being mindful of receiving feedback from groups that have a small groups (There are less than 10 people in the united states) constitutes the majority of the population and would require Paperwork Reduction Act.

### Examples

- Individuals in certain unique situations
- Highly specialized groups or organizations
