# Why we conduct research.

Human-centered design research is all about making things easier for the public and overall reducing burden on the people we serve. This is why the Paperwork Reduction Act is important, and for us to keep the spirit of the act in mind.  **Research is not inherently a violation of the Paperwork Reduction Act.** 

There are cases in which the paperwork reduction act applies. This guide will touch on different aspects and provide you additional context, links, and resources to connect you with people who will be able to talk to the specifics.

# How do I talk to customers?

There are several PRA-friendly ways you can gather feedback from your customers right now.











# More about this guide

The CMS [https://coda.io/d/_dUhaG1qZrKq/_sucwd](https://coda.io/d/_dUhaG1qZrKq/_sucwd)  maintains and updates this guide, leaning on input from [https://coda.io/d/_dUhaG1qZrKq/_suktO](https://coda.io/d/_dUhaG1qZrKq/_suktO) across the enterprise. When a CMS component uses the Human-Centered Design Process, various research methods can come into play.  Some of these research methods may trigger the Paperwork Reduction Act (PRA), because the research method may be collecting information from the general public.  

*The CXoE has created this guide in partnership with OSORA to help CMS employees understand and navigate the Paperwork Reduction Act, if applicable.*
