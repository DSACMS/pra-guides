**OSORA provides information about the Paperwork Reduction Act. See this link for a recorded presentation of the information presented here.** 

# What is the Paperwork Reduction Act (PRA)?

This federal law reduces, minimizes, and controls burdens and maximizes the practical utility of and public benefit from information collected by and for the Federal government. The PRA authorizes the Office of Management and Budget‚Äôs (OMB) Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs (OIRA) to oversee agency information collection efforts.

**Burden**: Total time, effort, or financial resources expended by persons to generate, maintain, retain, or disclose or provide information to or for a Federal agency*

## Why do we need the PRA?

- Reduces burden on the public
- Prevents federal government from collecting redundant information
- Ensures information collected is meaningful and accurate
- Allows government to weigh in on how government is collecting information
- Protects information privacy

## What is a collection of information?

**Collection of information:* *Obtaining, soliciting, or requiring the disclosure to third parties or the public of information (facts or opinions) by or for an agency by means of identical questions posed to, or identical reporting, record keeping, or disclosure requirements imposed on 10 or more persons, whether such collection of information is mandatory, voluntary, or necessary to obtain or retain a benefit.*

### Other PRA Exceptions

***‚õ≥Ô∏è  Mathias  question for 4/17 group session:*** *What should we put her for other PRA exceptions? When it doubt ask OSORA? Sometimes designers are stuck cross referencing internal documentation and documentation on* [pra.digital.gov](pra.digital.gov) *and have trouble.*

*What we don‚Äôt want is someone to feel stupid and then stop doing HCD activities or to hide activities from OSORA ‚Äî should be an open space to have questions answered.*
