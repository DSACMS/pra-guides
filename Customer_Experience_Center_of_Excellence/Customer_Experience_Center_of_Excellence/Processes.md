**Some things that would be helpful asked by cms employees**

- Why to go through PRA
- How to write your request
- How long of an estimate it would take to receive feedback
- How to answer issues that PRA raises
- What to do after it has been approved.
- Temporal perspective (What are the milestones, timebound, clearance is for a certain point and there’s a window to re-up)
  - Should be transparent — efficient as possible, multiple clearances around similar things
-
