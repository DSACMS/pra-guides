Connecting people with people is important to crucial to expediting processes and ensuring compliance with regulations. Knowing the right person to talk to can make all the difference in navigating the complexities of the paperwork reduction act and how it intersects with our work within CMS.  
  
Whether it’s understanding whether or not the research method you’ve chosen triggers the paperwork reduction act or if there is another method that you could choose that would reduce the number of people that we need receive feedback from to evaluate our designs, knowing who to talk to can save time and resources!







## **1️⃣ Responsible for Paperwork Reduction Act**

[Office of Strategic Operations and Regulatory Affairs (OSORA)](https://www.cms.gov/about-cms/agency-information/cmsleadership/office_osora) is responsible for various activities and manages CMS’ decision-making and regulatory process. This includes the Paperwork Reduction Act!

**Contact Information:**  

- William ‘Bill’ Parham <[william.parham@cms.hhs.gov](william.parham@cms.hhs.gov)>



Questions from 4/20:

- Any color to add, “Reach out any time for any things?” 
  - Early and often — longer time we have the better, come back as things evolve
- First place → List of staff and breakdown of which staff is assigned





## **2️⃣ Offices and Centers**

Almost all offices within CMS interact with the public. When your research question is related to work that might already be in flight it would be important to ask the groups who might have already conducted similar research. This would reduce the amount of burden we put on the public, but also allows you share learnings and insights across the organization.



***⛳️  Mathias  question for 4/17 group session:*** *Offices already have information collection packages. Should we also include the contact for those as well? For example, a project that involves adding a form onto* *[CMS.gov](CMS.gov)* *(Medical Bill Rights) has to conduct some discovery research, should that group have conversations with the office of communications before trying to create their own information collection package?*

*Used to be at the special assistant level.*

*Are there offices and centers that the footprint of PRA doesn’t make sense.*

*Contractors*

## 3️⃣ Communities

When your question is a more general or if you don’t know who to ask, asking the CMS community can be a great place to start! CMS has a couple of different slack channels where you can ask questions to help build your understanding of HCD and CX methods and how they might related to the Paperwork Reduction Act.

**Slack channels:**

- #cms-hcd-community
- #fed-hcd-community
- #paperwork-reduction-act





## 4️⃣ Where to go if you’re stuck

Sometimes navigating the complexities of a large organization can be tricky. If you think you are stuck or you want someone to bounce some ideas.



***⛳️  Mathias  question for 4/17 group session:*** *What should people doing if they are at an impasse? Office hours where HCD + CX + PRA people can chat it out? Escalation path to a leader (Kerrian + Ariele)? What would be something that would do the most good?*

*If you get stuck → PRA applicable or*

*Area this seems to work well - OIT*
