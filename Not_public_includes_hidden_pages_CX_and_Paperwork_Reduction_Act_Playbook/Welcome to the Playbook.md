# Why does the PRA matter?

Human-centered design research is all about making things easier for the public and overall reducing burden on the people we serve. This is why the Paperwork Reduction Act is important, and for us to keep the spirit of the act in mind.  Read more at [https://coda.io/d/_du87PN18l4Y/_suVJB](https://coda.io/d/_du87PN18l4Y/_suVJB) .

# About the PRA

This federal law reduces, minimizes, and controls burdens and maximizes the practical utility of and public benefit from information collected by and for the Federal government. The PRA authorizes the Office of Management and Budget’s (OMB) Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs (OIRA) to oversee agency information collection efforts. 

The PRA process at CMS is managed by [Office of Strategy Operations and Regulatory Affairs](https://coda.io/d/_du87PN18l4Y/_sud6M).
