Getting feedback remains important to reducing public burdens. Depending on what you’re getting feedback on (and other consideration), you may be subject to PRA. Learn more about the different types of cases where getting to public feedback furthers an agency mission.

Should you have any questions, don’t hesitate to reach out to OSORA. See [https://coda.io/d/_du87PN18l4Y/_sud6M](https://coda.io/d/_du87PN18l4Y/_sud6M)

### What happens when you are making a upgrade from an non-digital information collection.

Digitizing information collection is an important aspect of reducing burden.  Many existing, PRA-approved paper-based forms can benefit from a conversion to an interactive form, like a web-based form or an editable PDF.

As long as the approved form fields and questions are not changed and the digital materials collects the same information, OIRA would likely consider conversion to an electronic format a non-substantive change to an already approved collection, and it wouldn’t need additional public comment. Items that are purely cosmetic in nature, but can increase usability such: as changing a checkbox to a radio button are generally 

However, many agencies find that a form conversion will spark other, more substantive changes in what information is collected and how questions are written. This may change or increase the amount of burden, or trigger questions regarding practical utility, resulting in the need for additional public comment.
