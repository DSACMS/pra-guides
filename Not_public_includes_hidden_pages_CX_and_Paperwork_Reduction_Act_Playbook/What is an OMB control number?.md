Most forms that go through the PRA process must display an OMB control number. Everything from customer satisfaction surveys to application for enrollments. This can be a good thing to keep an eye out for as you’re looking at forms across government (and you can ask ‘how did *they* do that???’)  
  
Approved information collections must display an Office of Management and Budget (OMB) control number and an expiration date.  An approval usually expires three years after OMB grants it.

For example, [Application for Enrollment in Medicare Part B](https://www.cms.gov/cms40b-application-enrollment-part-b) (Medical Insurance) has an OMB Number of 0938-1230.
