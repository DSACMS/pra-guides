Knowing when PRA clearance is needed or not needed can be tricky. We hope this non-exhaustive list addresses some of your concerns about conducting customer experience research activities at CMS.

The follow scenarios describe circumstances when PRA clearance may be needed for the agency to consider your activities PRA compliant. 

- Speaking with more than 10 people at a time
- Voluntary, mandatory or necessary requests for the public’s information
- Research studies and focus groups with the same set of structured sets of questions
- Asking demographic information
- More generally, PRA clearances are likely needed for the following types of information collections. Learn more at [https://coda.io/d/_du87PN18l4Y/_sulQX](https://coda.io/d/_du87PN18l4Y/_sulQX) for additional context. 

### Research Study Design Examples

If you are unclear if your study requires clearance, we encourage you to reach out to the CXCOE for general study design consultation and OSORA for PRA implications.

# When PRA clearance is not needed for CX

The following scenarios describe circumstances when PRA clearance may be needed for the agency to consider your activities PRA compliant. 

- Speaking with federal employees about their work  — and contractors (it depends 🙂)
- Speaking with less than 10 people at a time
- Direct observation, such as watching how long it takes someone to complete a transaction, or how someone uses a new website to find answers.
- General requests for public input and comments, such as a “Tell Us About Your Experience” sheet with open-ended space for someone to respond.
- Information for voluntary commercial transactions, like payment and delivery details.
- Information asked for or received in connection with a public hearing or meeting.
- Open-ended survey questions such as “Could you please look at your form and tell me what you think?”
