Identifying who collects the information helps clarifies how best to navigate PRA.  Depending on who’s collecting the information, including other considerations, your research may be subject to PRA or invite certain limitations on how and when you ask for feedback. 

Federal Contracting and acting as our agent - to collect the information, the burden is still on the public. Instead of CMS and regular federal employees, we’ve had contractors run the show — the program area has to be involved and be aware. Burden on the government is the cost of the contract.

Should you have any questions, don’t hesitate to reach out to OSORA. See [https://coda.io/d/_du87PN18l4Y/_sud6M](https://coda.io/d/_du87PN18l4Y/_sud6M)

# Federal Employees

When a federal employee collects information, it could be to... 

- Provide access to a service
- Provide access to a product
- Evaluate a program
- And so much more... 

```
What about when PRA collection already attached to a service?
```

### Examples

- [Healthcare.gov](Healthcare.gov) application

# Federal Contractors

- Conducting user research or surveys with Federal Contractors

```
When a contractor collects feedback, how is that handled? Should these information collections always go through a COR, main point of contract, someone more familiar with the PRA.
```

### Examples

- ???

# Federal Grantees

[Insert light touch OSORA guidance/explanation of what falls into this category] Acting as our agent.

```
Same thing with Federal Contractors? these are indpendent organizations who are providing services with federal money -- I'm sure there's some nuance here but 
```

### Examples

- Cooperative Agreements
