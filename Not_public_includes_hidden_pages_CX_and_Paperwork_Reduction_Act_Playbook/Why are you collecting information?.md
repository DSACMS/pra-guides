Knowing why you’re getting feedback helps keep researchers focused on minimizing participant burden.  Depending on why you’re getting feedback from, including other considerations, your research may be subject to PRA or invite certain limitations on how and when you ask for feedback. 

Should you have any questions, don’t hesitate to reach out to OSORA. See [https://coda.io/d/_du87PN18l4Y/_sud6M](https://coda.io/d/_du87PN18l4Y/_sud6M)

Maybe slim this down and leave it for the future opportunities. Simple is better, that might be very vanilla PRA — Practical Utility — bring the specificity the prevailing providers, they have to have a real use in relative real time — that real need that might help push the process along. This is what we need, how do we get it, if they can answer that succinctly.
