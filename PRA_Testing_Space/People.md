We encourage you to connect with people to ensure compliance with regulations. Knowing the right person to speak with makes a huge difference when navigating  Paperwork Reduction Act and how it interacts with CX activities at CMS. 

The following organizations can help you do the following:

- Understand whether or not the research method you’ve chosen triggers the paperwork reduction act
- Assist in reviewing your research design plan and see how it may or may not interact with PRA
- Redirect you to customer experience specialist across the agency with experience in CX research design





# **1️⃣ Responsible for Paperwork Reduction Act**

[Office of Strategic Operations and Regulatory Affairs (OSORA)](https://www.cms.gov/about-cms/agency-information/cmsleadership/office_osora) is responsible for the CMS Paperwork Reduction process and other regulatory affairs. They are the subject matter experts on the PRA.  

Often times it can take some time to navigate the clearance process. Reaching out early and often ensures that if an information collection request is appropriate.

# **2️⃣ Offices and Centers**

Almost all offices within CMS interact with the public. When your research question is related to work that might already be in flight it would be important to ask the groups who might have already conducted similar research. This would reduce the amount of burden we put on the public, but also allows you share learnings and insights across the organization.

# 3️⃣ Communities

When your question is a more general or if you don’t know who to ask, asking the CMS community can be a great place to start! CMS has a couple of different slack channels where you can ask questions to help build your understanding of HCD and CX methods and how they might related to the Paperwork Reduction Act.
