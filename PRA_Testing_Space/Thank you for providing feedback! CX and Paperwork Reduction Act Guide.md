# About this Guide

The CMS [https://coda.io/d/_dhNnUPAPgfc/_sucwd](https://coda.io/d/_dhNnUPAPgfc/_sucwd)  maintains and updates this guide, leaning on input from [https://coda.io/d/_dhNnUPAPgfc/_su4yK](https://coda.io/d/_dhNnUPAPgfc/_su4yK) across the enterprise. When a CMS component uses the Human-Centered Design Process, various research methods can come into play.  Some of these research methods may trigger the Paperwork Reduction Act (PRA), because the research method may be collecting information from the general public.  

*The CXoE has created this guide in partnership with OSORA to help CMS employees understand and navigate the Paperwork Reduction Act, if applicable.*
