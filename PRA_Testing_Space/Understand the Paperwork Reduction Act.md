**OSORA provides information about the Paperwork Reduction Act. See this link for a recorded presentation of the information presented here.** 

# What is the Paperwork Reduction Act (PRA)?

This federal law reduces, minimizes, and controls burdens and maximizes the practical utility of and public benefit from information collected by and for the Federal government. The PRA authorizes the Office of Management and Budget‚Äôs (OMB) Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs (OIRA) to oversee agency information collection efforts.

**Burden**: Total time, effort, or financial resources expended by persons to generate, maintain, retain, or disclose or provide information to or for a Federal agency*

## Why do we need the PRA?

- Reduces burden on the public
- Prevents federal government from collecting redundant information
- Ensures information collected is meaningful and accurate
- Allows government to weigh in on how government is collecting information
- Protects information privacy

In addition to the [normal PRA clearance](https://pra.digital.gov/clearance-process/), there are many other types of clearances. These labels can be confusing, but are used only in very specific circumstances. We‚Äôre here to help get you on the right track to approval.

1. **Normal** clearance, for New requests, Revision and Extension requests, and Reinstatement requests.
2. **Common Form** clearance, for a form already approved and in use by another agency.
3. **Generic** clearance, which includes the fast-track process after it‚Äôs granted.
4. **Emergency/Expedited** review and clearance (used in very limited cases).
