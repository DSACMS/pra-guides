Knowing who you’re getting feedback from improves understanding how to reduce public burdens.  Depending on who (and how many people) you’re getting feedback from, including other considerations, your research may be subject to PRA or invite certain limitations on how and when you ask for feedback. 

In general, asking federal employees or contractors would not be subject to PRA.

Should you have any questions, don’t hesitate to reach out to OSORA. See [https://coda.io/d/_dhNnUPAPgfc/_su4yK](https://coda.io/d/_dhNnUPAPgfc/_su4yK)
