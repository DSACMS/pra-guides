Identifying who collects the information helps clarifies how best to navigate PRA.  Depending on who’s collecting the information, including other considerations, your research may be subject to PRA or invite certain limitations on how and when you ask for feedback. 

Should you have any questions, don’t hesitate to reach out to OSORA. See [https://coda.io/d/_dhNnUPAPgfc/_su4yK](https://coda.io/d/_dhNnUPAPgfc/_su4yK)
