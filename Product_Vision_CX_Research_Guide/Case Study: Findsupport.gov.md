# üí°Example - So you want to collect information to build or make improvements to a project?



There might be different considerations based on what type of project you‚Äôre working on. A website that is designed to communicate policy would be different than modernizing a system. Providing PRA considerations for the following questions would give teams better insight into what might need clearances.

## What part of the project are we getting feedback on?

1. Parts that communicate policy (e.g. Medical Bill Rights)
2. Parts that provide services (e.g. Healthcare.gov, Medical Bill Rights)
   1. Is it a net new item?
   2. Is it a legacy upgrade from an analog?
3. Parts that provide education (e.g. Findsupport.gov)
4. Parts that are digitizing...
   1. ...something that is analog to digital?
   2. ...something that is already digital but is being improved?
5. Parts that are modernizing a system based on new regulation ?

## What is the goal of the information collection?

1. Is the information collection related to policy?
   1. Has that policy been written yet?
   2. What stage is the rule in?
   3. Has that policy been open to public comment yet?
   4. More???
2. Is the information collection related to a service?
   1. New service?
   2. Existing service?
      1. Already have PRA collection already attached to it?

## Who is the audience?

1. ‚ÄúGeneral‚Äù - Broad audiences, everyone in the country, an entire pillar of CMS (Medicare, Medicaid, and Marketplace beneficiaries) 
2. ‚ÄúInformed‚Äù - Narrow audiences, people who are knowledgable about the topic but might not have specialized knowledge (Physicians, broad medical providers, etc)
3. ‚ÄúSpecialists‚Äù - people who are knowledgable and are specialists about a very specific topic (Dentists and Dental Billing Specialists)

## What type of feedback are you looking to receive?

1. Generative 
   1. Feedback to define direction
   2. Feedback to define shape of product 
2. Evaluative
   1. Feedback to define improvements
   2. Feedback to define opportunities
