In addition to the [normal PRA clearance](https://pra.digital.gov/clearance-process/), there are many other types of clearances. These labels can be confusing, but are used only in very specific circumstances. Please read through 



# Normal clearance

Most common form of PRA approval requests. Used for...

- New information collection requests
- Revisions
- Extension requests
- Reinstatement requests
- Collection in Use with out an OMB control number
- Non-substantive Change Request



# Common Form clearance

Information collection where one agency will host collection to use itself, and additional agencies can request to use that collection. The requesting agency must use the information for the same purpose.

Requesting agencies go through expedited approval for common forms.



# Generic clearance

Allows for conducting more than one information collection using similar methods. Although th

Generic clearance is best when you’ll have multiple collections which:

- Request similar information,
- Have a low burden estimate,
- Don’t raise substantive or policy issues, and
- Have details that won’t be known until shortly before you collect data.

Customer satisfaction surveys, focus group tests, and usability surveys are good fits for generic clearance.

## *Fast Track process*

Fast-track requests generally don’t have to undergo additional public comment, and are reviewed after submitting all materials.

Your data collection activity may be eligible for the Fast Track process if it meets all of the below factors:

- [ ] Focused on improving existing or future services, products, or communication materials
- [ ] Participation is voluntary
- [ ] Statistical rigor is not required
- [ ] Burden on participants is not high
- [ ] Public dissemination of results is not intended.



# Expedited clearance

Expedited clearance entails an information collection request being submitted through the normal, non-emergency process, but then the agency asks OMB to approve it as soon as possible, if not immediately after the 30-day public comment period concludes. 

# Emergency clearance

This is a rare type of approval granted only when there is a time-sensitive need for the collection based on very specific criteria for reasons outside of the agency’s control. 

Usually, a collection is only eligible for this approval type if the standard PRA approval process would cause:

1.  Public harm is reasonably likely to result if normal clearance procedures are followed;
2. An unanticipated event has occurred; or
3. The use of normal clearance procedures is reasonably likely to prevent or disrupt the collection of information or is reasonably likely to cause a statutory or court ordered deadline to be missed.



**Internal delays are not emergencies; We strongly encourage planning ahead.**
