Using data from customer research and feedback can actually reduce the public burdens the PRA seeks to regulate. [OMB recently published additional guidance](https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/M-22-10.pdf) on reducing burden that reminds federal agencies of their responsibilities to not only measure burden, but actively work to reduce it. **Here are some things that you could do tomorrow to receive feedback on your product:**

### Critique and Hallway Testing

Sometimes the feedback that you’re looking for is more appropriate with colleagues. Basic usability testing, heuristic analysis, and accessibility testing by other people on your team who aren’t as deep in the weeds can highlight areas for improvement in your products. Always consider sharing with team members before recruiting members of the public.

### Interviews/Ethnographic Research

The PRA applies to collections of information using identical questions posed to ten or more people. This means that you can interview 9 or fewer participants using identical questions. This also means that if you are having unstructured conversations with open-ended questions, there may not be a limit on participants*

### Prototype Testing

If you are having an unstructured conversation in front of a clickable screen or some paper forms, you can talk to your customers. Open-ended questions, such as these, are not a violation of the PRA:

" “Could you please take a look at this form and tell me what you think?”

" “How do you think would complete this task?”

### Surveys

Open-ended questions do not violate the PRA. So, if you are doing a one or two question “Tell us how we’re doing” survey, please move forward.

However, some surveys DO need to have a clearance. CMS a few existing clearances that may apply to your survey such as the C[CSQ HCD Center of Excellence.](https://qnetconfluence.cms.gov/display/HCD/Paperwork+Reduction+Act') . Please work with OSORA to determine the appropriate clearance and process for your needs.
