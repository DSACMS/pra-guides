When conducting research, seeking PRA approval may not be appropriate for the type and quality of information you seek to collect. You also may be waiting for PRA approval to come through, but need initial customer research to make key design decisions. Start by designing a PRA compliant study to accomplish your initial research goals. 



# Planning today, to get feedback tomorrow.

There are a number of techniques you can use to get quick feedback that is low burden. Unstructured one-on-one observational conversations are typically okay. To learn more about them read more about it [https://coda.io/d/_dIWMgaXtu3c/_su_tw](https://coda.io/d/_dIWMgaXtu3c/_su_tw) 



# Larger HCD PRA Compliant Study Design Tips

- [ ]  Limit each round of studies to 9 or fewer individuals* at a time
- [ ] For interviews: make sure guide reflects, non-standardized conversation
- [ ] Use low-burden research methods
- [ ] For surveys: ask broad, open-ended questions
- [ ] Skew toward direct observation methods, see [https://coda.io/d/_dIWMgaXtu3c/_sueju](https://coda.io/d/_dIWMgaXtu3c/_sueju) for examples
- [ ] Federal employees and contractors are not subject to PRA
- [ ] Consider doing user research after the policymaking process has completed, if the user research topic is directly tied to the policyâ€™s implementation
