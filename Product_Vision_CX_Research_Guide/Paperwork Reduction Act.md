# Why the Paperwork Reduction Act (PRA) matters

Human-centered design research is all about making things easier for the public and overall reducing burden on the people we serve. This is why the Paperwork Reduction Act is important, and for us to keep the spirit of the act in mind.  Read more at [https://coda.io/d/_dIWMgaXtu3c/_suVJB](https://coda.io/d/_dIWMgaXtu3c/_suVJB) .

> **Research is not inherently a violation of the Paperwork Reduction Act.** 

There are low burden opportunities that you can plan for today, so that to get feedback tomorrow.

# About the PRA

This federal law reduces, minimizes, and controls burdens and maximizes the practical utility of and public benefit from information collected by and for the Federal government. The PRA authorizes the Office of Management and Budgetâ€™s (OMB) Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs (OIRA) to oversee agency information collection efforts. 

The PRA process at CMS is managed by OSORA. Read more about OSORA at [https://coda.io/d/_dIWMgaXtu3c/_su2Vm](https://coda.io/d/_dIWMgaXtu3c/_su2Vm).

## What PRA does

- Reduces burden on the public
