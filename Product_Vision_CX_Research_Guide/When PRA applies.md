- Written reports, such as grantee performance reports.
- Surveys, such as customer satisfaction or behavioral surveys.
- Record-keeping requirements, such as small businesses keeping all tax-related documents for 3 years.
- Third-party or public disclosures, such as nutrition labeling requirements for food.
- Program evaluations, such as looking at the outcomes of a subsidized housing initiative for seniors.
- Research studies and focus groups with a set of the same questions or tasks.
- Applications for benefits and grant programs.
- Open-ended survey questions 

### HCD Methods (PRA-clearance may be required)

- Usability study (large sample size at a time)
- Interview (scripted, 10 or more participants)

# When it does not apply

### There are many different ways to receive customer feedback at different stages in the design process. The above is not a comprehensive list. The CXCOE will be creating and referencing more resources over the upcoming months. [In the meantime, referencing The Lab at OPM‚Äôs Human Centered Design Guides are helpful!](https://the-lab-at-opm.github.io/website/hcd-guide/design/)
